# Personal Audio Eliza  
When the original ELIZA first appeared in the 60's, some people actually mistook her for human. The illusion of intelligence works best, however, if you limit your conversation to talking about yourself and your life. It was text-based however, which was quite convincing during the age of IRC chatrooms and such.  

It takes your sentence and reflects it into a question through string substitution and pattern matching. Transforming "Tell me what you think about me" into "You want me to tell you what I think about you?" creating a simple illusion of understanding. 

This project brings speech (Bing Speech) to Eliza through the high accessibility of Skype similar to the previous iteration, [‘Audio Eliza’](https://github.com/sang004/AudioEliza), but with a twist. Personal Audio Eliza has a mode to record an individual’s voice as a profile and use that profile to talk back.  

To start chat, click on our live link to add the bot to your Skype contacts:  
[![Add the bot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8290469/28764707-816c05dc-75f9-11e7-83b0-a37abae0cf49.jpg)](https://join.skype.com/bot/b0179619-fe22-4cbf-a5a9-c927d06b30bc)

__Step 1__: Call it  
__Step 2__: Choose either call / record on the rich card  
__Step 3__: Type in the name of the profile you wish to record as or talk to  

__Record mode__: Wait for the sentences to appear in messaging box and say the sentence or anything you would like. It will take around 7mins of your life, once done, stay on the line until it says, “upload completed”. (Do contact us at proj_call@outlook.com if you want your clips removed after trying, we are very friendly.)  

__Call mode__: Be moderately amazed that you are talking to your own voice or someone else’s! To end the call just say “bye” or click on “End call”

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
__Always run Visual studio as ADMINISTRATOR__

## Prerequisites

Things you need to install:

- Windows 8 and above  
- [Visual Studio Community edition 2015 and above](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)  
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)  
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/)  

## Setup  

### Bot setup  
https://itsamiraclemycodeworks.wordpress.com/2017/01/31/first-blog-post/  

Firstly, login into _bot framework directory_ then click create bot  
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27782087-92c97712-6003-11e7-8e54-94dbdd287689.png)  

Then describe it  
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27782129-bd5b28ae-6003-11e7-9038-510d1fea540e.png)  

For this field, you will need the host address of where it is hosted. Either in a tunneling address from _ngrok_ or _Azure_ app service host.  
```
https://a8e2caa6.ngrok.io/api/messages
https://callingbot01name.azurewebsites.net/api/messages
```

And follow through the instructions after clicking the create microsoft app id and password.

Leave every thing else as default and click on save settings.  

With the bot up, you should be able to see some default channels  
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27782415-09bafa5c-6005-11e7-9900-02a351b51985.png)  

Finally, to add call ability to the bot, select edit on the "Skype" channel and onto the "Calling" tab. Enable "Calling" and populate the webhook  
```
https://a8e2caa6.ngrok.io/api/calling/call
https://callingbot01name.azurewebsites.net/api/calling/call
```

### Initial Solution setup
After cloning the repository, go to the directory:  
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27780440-7ac02f60-5ffb-11e7-9369-e11014e58aa5.png)    
Access 'C:\Users\user\Source\Repos\bot\.vs\config\applicationhost.config' and edit this file  
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27780484-c9662ac0-5ffb-11e7-8d71-6462a94f6d34.png)  
At line 168, replicate the line and paste below it. At the replicated line, change "localhost" to astriek to tell the application to listen to every process on the port 3999.  
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27780538-11a905d2-5ffc-11e7-870e-9984997c7d07.png)  

### Web.Config Configurations  
There are a few sections of _Web.config_ that requires attention:
- Bot  
Tells the bot framework connector which bot should be used. With parameters of bot ID (name of your bot) and the Microsoft application credentials attached to it.  
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27781447-7ce3e7a0-6000-11e7-9b9e-08de78736f33.png)  

- Local  
The bot can be hosted locally on your desktop, it is good for repeated testing and debugging. When running it locally, it requires a tunneling program [_ngrok_](#Local) to be running, explanation is as below.
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27781502-ad0b015c-6000-11e7-9080-5aee7192500b.png) 

- Azure  
When the code is ready, deploying to Azure will allow the bot to run without the need to keeping your desktop alive. Trial account is available for 1 month with 200USD credit. (at the time of this writing)  
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27781476-969024c0-6000-11e7-94bc-3141519ecd47.png)  

 
- Other services  
Services such as [_Bing speech_](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/) is required for transcribing the caller's speech to text and in order for the code to know how to respond.
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27781547-ea00db5e-6000-11e7-99c1-fcd6c24c43dc.png)  

## Deployment  

### Local  
Run code visual studio as **administrator**, in project folder "..\bot\.vs\config\applicationhost.config", make sure to add
```xml
<binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:3999:*" />
```
at line below line 168 to ensure that the tunneling would work.

In ngrok, type "ngrok http 3999" to start the tunneling from bot framework connector to your running code, it will show that an address that look like:
```
http://a8e2caa6.ngrok.io
```
In bot framework portal, set bot messaging endpoint to
```
https://a8e2caa6.ngrok.io/api/messages
```

and skype channel's calling webhook to
```
https://a8e2caa6.ngrok.io/api/calling/call
```  

When the configurations are done, just click on the play button at the top to start the code!

### Azure
Open up the soluution, right click the project and click 'Publish':

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27728398-76b3733a-5db4-11e7-84e3-916eb9ed46ac.png)

With this, click on next and change the name of the application if desired. There is an option of Debug/Release, as this is a working copy, choosing 'Release' is fine. So click 'Publish'

To change if the published code is going to be in DEBUG / RELEASE MODE, click "edit settings" and change it here:

## Running the tests

Before the bot is published onto the Microsoft bot directory that is visible to the public, you can add the bot by clicking on the Skype icon here:  
![Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8624828/27786328-4820edd4-6013-11e7-8811-6ce90a0ff07f.png)

And just call it and start talking :)

The bot requires 2 text input to start
